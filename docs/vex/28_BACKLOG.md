# PURPOSE

This document contains every planned initiative for VEX.

It is the single source of truth for future work.

Every backlog item must represent a validated problem, not simply an idea.

The objective is maximizing customer value while minimizing unnecessary complexity.

---

# BACKLOG PHILOSOPHY

The backlog is ordered by value.

Not by excitement.

Not by novelty.

Not by engineering preference.

Every item competes for limited engineering capacity.

Adding a new item means delaying another.

---

# PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK

Every item is evaluated using the following dimensions.

Customer Impact

Revenue Impact

Operational Improvement

Risk Reduction

Engineering Enablement

Strategic Alignment

Engineering Effort

Complexity Introduced

Maintenance Cost

Long-Term Value

Priority is determined by the balance between value and complexity.

---

# STATUS DEFINITIONS

Each backlog item must have one status.

IDEA

Validated problem not yet analyzed.

---

RESEARCH

Currently under investigation.

---

READY

Fully specified.

Ready for implementation.

---

IN PROGRESS

Actively being developed.

---

BLOCKED

Cannot proceed due to dependency.

---

VALIDATION

Implemented.

Waiting for production validation.

---

DONE

Completed and validated.

---

REJECTED

Will never be implemented.

Reason must be documented.

---

# FEATURE ACCEPTANCE RULES

Before implementation every feature must answer:

Which customer problem does it solve?

How often does that problem occur?

Why now?

Can it be solved more simply?

What is the operational cost?

What is the maintenance cost?

Can it be tested?

Can it be rolled back?

If these questions cannot be answered,

the feature should remain in the backlog.

---

# DEFINITION OF READY

A feature is READY only if:

Problem validated.

Requirements documented.

Architecture approved.

Dependencies known.

Tests planned.

Rollback possible.

Documentation planned.

Monitoring considered.

Ready means engineering can start immediately.

---

# DEFINITION OF DONE

A feature is DONE only if:

Implementation completed.

Tests passing.

Code reviewed.

Documentation updated.

Deployment completed.

Production validated.

Monitoring active.

Knowledge preserved.

Done means valuable to customers.

Not merely merged.

---

# BACKLOG RULES

Never implement directly from ideas.

Research before implementation.

Document before coding.

Measure after deployment.

Archive rejected ideas.

Avoid duplicate backlog items.

Small backlog.

High quality.

---

# REJECTED IDEAS

Rejected ideas remain documented.

Each rejection records:

Reason.

Date.

Decision owner.

Related ADR.

Rejected ideas prevent repeated discussions.

---

# ROADMAP ALIGNMENT

Every backlog item must support at least one roadmap objective.

If not,

it should not exist.

---

# MONTHLY REVIEW

Once every month:

Remove obsolete items.

Merge duplicates.

Review priorities.

Archive completed work.

Review rejected ideas.

The backlog is continuously curated.

---

# ENGINEERING PRINCIPLE

Engineering time is the most valuable resource in the company.

Protect it by prioritizing relentlessly.

---

# AI GUIDANCE

Before implementing any feature:

Read this backlog.

Confirm priority.

Check dependencies.

Search for existing ADRs.

Search for Known Issues.

Never implement work that is not represented here unless explicitly instructed.
