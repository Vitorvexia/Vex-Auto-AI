# PURPOSE

This document represents the current operational state of VEX.

Unlike architecture documents,

this file changes frequently.

Every engineer.

Every AI.

Every contributor.

Must read this document before starting any task.

It answers one question:

"What is the current state of the project?"

# CURRENT OBJECTIVES

Primary Goal

Validate the MVP in production.

Current Focus

Reliability.

Bug fixing.

Operational validation.

Infrastructure stabilization.

NOT feature expansion.

Until MVP validation is complete,

new features should only be implemented when explicitly approved.

---

# CURRENT PRIORITIES

Priority 1

Fix blocking bugs.

Priority 2

Validate production environment.

Priority 3

Complete operational testing.

Priority 4

Improve observability.

Priority 5

Only then begin new feature development.

# ACTIVE BLOCKERS

Critical blockers should always remain here. Source: CLAUDE.md (2026-07-20 audit), all operational/config — no code work pending.

B001

`WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` points at sandbox (`1150232648165177`). Real Speed Motos number (`1233441783176942`) is `ON_PREMISE`, incompatible with Cloud API. Follow-up and reactivation sends fail in production as a result.

Status

Pending — register real Cloud API number in Meta Business Manager, update env on Vercel.

---

B002

Permanent WhatsApp Token pending. Temporary token in prod; System User Token to be generated via business.facebook.com.

B003

~~`CRON_SECRET` not configured on Vercel.~~ RESOLVED — verified 2026-07-21: `vercel env ls production` shows `CRON_SECRET` set (Preview + Production, since ~40 days prior). Code (`route.ts:47-52`) only falls back to the insecure any-Bearer path when the var is absent — not the case in production.

B004

~~Migration 020 not yet applied in production.~~ RESOLVED — verified 2026-07-21 via direct read-only query against production Supabase (`leads` table returns `vehicle_id`/`valor_final` columns, no PGRST error).

Status

Resolved (2026-07-21)

B005

MVP end-to-end acceptance test (real WhatsApp number → AI pipeline → close with margin guardrail) blocked until B001-B002 clear.

# RECENT COMPLETED WORK

Most recent accomplishments (source: git log, most recent first).

✅ isNaN guards for preco/custo in updateVehicle (4505933)

✅ MVP hardening — sales guardrails, PII masking, inventory fixes, audit repairs (e61a7cf)

✅ Unarchive vehicle action and button (4682fd5)

✅ Real inventory CRUD and AI vehicle context (d4c9a99)

✅ Vercel Cron GET accepted when CRON_SECRET absent (a06035c, PR #24)

✅ Mina de Ouro Core — reactivation template enrichment + result metrics (8b1927e, PR #23)

✅ Equipe (team) page — real data, team-metrics, operational dashboard (4285a93, PR #20)

✅ Assigned To + initial salesperson management (7204bf4, PR #19)

Update this section continuously — do not let it silently rot like it did before this pass.

# CURRENT KNOWN RISKS

LLM timeout under heavy load.

Cron execution time.

Meta API availability.

WhatsApp rate limits.

Infrastructure dependency on Supabase.

Every active risk belongs here.

---

# CURRENT TECHNICAL DEBT

Only active debt. Source: CLAUDE.md 2026-07-20 audit.

RBAC absent — any store user can reassign any lead (`assignLeadToUser`/`removeLeadAssignment` only check `store_id`). Blocks reliable commission attribution.

Message query has no limit.

`error_category`/`error_message` missing in `reactivation_logs`/`follow_up_logs` — WhatsApp send failures in cron jobs are silent (observability gap).

Lead assignment has no history — only current `assigned_to` is stored. Needed before commission/ROI auditing.

`calculateOperationalMetrics()` does not use `leads.valor_final` (exists since migration 020) — no revenue, margin-per-sale, or CAC in analytics yet.

Document every intentional debt.

# CURRENT TEAM FOCUS

Current Sprint Goal

Validate MVP.

Engineering Rule

Do not increase complexity unnecessarily.

Current Philosophy

Stability over speed.

---

# WHAT IS NOT BEING DONE

To avoid scope creep:

No CRM expansion.

No marketplace.

No mobile app.

No unnecessary integrations.

No AI experiments outside roadmap.

No architecture rewrites.

Focus remains validation.

# ENGINEERING NOTES

Temporary information useful during current development.

Should be cleaned periodically.

This section is intentionally mutable.

---

# AI CONTEXT

Any AI starting work should understand:

The MVP is feature-complete.

Current work is validation.

Stability has priority over velocity.

Avoid architectural changes unless explicitly requested.

Respect the Constitution.

Read Known Issues before debugging.

Read Backlog before implementing.

Read AI Memory before making assumptions.

Never start coding without understanding current project status.

---

# EXIT CRITERIA FOR MVP VALIDATION

The MVP is considered validated only when:

□ Production environment configured.

□ WhatsApp production number operational.

□ Token permanent.

□ Migration applied.

□ CRON validated.

□ End-to-end tests completed.

□ No critical bugs.

□ Operational logs healthy.

□ Internal pilot completed.

Only after every checkbox is complete may the project move to the next phase.
